# weather-dashboard
This week's assignment is the Weather Dashboard. As a user, we want to create a weather dashboard where they can search a particular city and view the current forecast. The forecase will include the temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index. A 5-day forecast will be shown below what the weather will look like in the future.
